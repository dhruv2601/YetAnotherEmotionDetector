```

In order to create a new experiment, clone one of the experiments folder and edit the `config.py` file with your information. You must have a GPU for it to work otherwise it won't run.
Also, dowload this data `https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge` and have the `.csv` in the `data` directory.
```zsh
    python3 run_experiment.py -f <exp_folder_name>
```

## Architecture

## Dataset

The original dataset is a grayscale image(originall in a different representation), as an experiment, we implement a model for facial landmarking to crop faces from images and compare accuracy. The motivation for cropping the faces is to reduce noise from the images and highlight useful features.

## Results

The highest accuracy we received is ~80% on validation, which surpasses the current higest accuracy in the kaggle competition(from where the dataset is taken). Below are the results.

## The Horror that lasts a lifetime

We decided to interpret the results from our CNN layers to understand the representations that each layer learns for an image.
